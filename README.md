# How to Install

1) Download `main.py` from this repo. 
2) Download `Visual Studio Code` (or any other Python IDE but I reccomend VSCode)
3) Download `Python` on your PC if you dont aready have it. **When installing make sure you select "Add Python to PATH"**
4) Create a folder anywhere on your computer called `Code`
5) Move `main.py` into your new folder.
6) Open VSCode and select "Open Folder".![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7624e37-4c25-4d34-b7ab-5de5c9bf5a8b)
7) Navigate to where the folder you made in step 4 is and open it. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/471875c6-c39c-409e-ae4b-4ec7b85d7b7e)

9) In terminal, run `python -m venv venv` , and then `venv\Scripts\activate` (this is optional but helps keep your PC more organized if you plan on coding in the future) 
10) Type `pip install tkinter`
11) After that installs type in `python main.py` and now the program is running.
